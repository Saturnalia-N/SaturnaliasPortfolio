                    <h2>The Sky's The Limit</h2>
                    <h3>For the past 3 years I have been writing a book about a crew of young adults that go looking for the most sought after thing in the world. It is a castle that holds the most valuable treasures in the world.</h3>
                    <h4>Heres The Introduction Paragraph:</h4>
                    <p>
                    Have you ever heard about the castle? Well, the story goes like this: <br>
                    there is a castle that is said to contain riches and items beyond human understanding,<br>
                    things that could destroy the world or bring peace depending on how you want to use it. <br>
                    Things that could grant wishes or power, the castle was said to be filled with these items that <br>
                    together could buy the world, though this is all a story that some believe or a dream that was said to not exist,<br>
                    there was one man who found it but vanished before revealing its true location.<br>
                    With this information, thousands of people have set out to find this castle but will anyone really find it<br>
                    or will it remain a mystery forever?

                    <h2>Progress</h2>
                    <p>
                       Although I have been working on this story for 3 years it is not something that I put all my time into. So far I only have about 20 pages/4 chapters written of the story. I do have all the characters and their backstories plus the entire world planned out. I also have the whole story and the ending planned out I have just not taken the time to write anything. :(
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       Hopefully by the time I update everything for my final project I will have done more to share!! :)

                    <h2>Story Details</h2>
                    <h4>These details are more for my own pleasure to write down as I enjoy sharing small details about what I'm creating with others!</h4>
                    <p>
                    In this story the world building is more like dnd but also like normal life. The world has very advanced tech but is also set in the past with magic, integrating these two concepts into everyday tools.

                    <p>
                    We start the story seeing the two main characters as little kids talking under the stary night. That night they promise eachother that they would do the impossible and find the castle from the fairy tail. After a time skip we see them heading out on their quest.
